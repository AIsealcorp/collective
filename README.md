[Supertype Collective](https://collective.supertype.ai) is a community of analytics developers, data scientists and engineering leaders building products across the full stack. It a highly curated place, with close collaboration between members looking to join forces on building high-impact analytics products. 

### Joining the Collective
We welcome members from all backgrounds, anywhere in the world, who wish to contribute to the Collective's vision of building an inclusive, collaborative, and healthy community of full stack analytics developers. 

Read [the Wiki page](https://github.com/supertypeai/collective/wiki) for more details on joining the Collective.

## Getting Started (for Collective members)
Supertype Collective is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. You should be able to get started by cloning the repo and running `yarn install` (preferred) or `npm install`. This installs all the dependencies and you should be able to run the development server with `yarn dev` (preferred) or `npm run dev`. Proceed to the [Wiki page](https://github.com/supertypeai/collective/wiki) for instructions on creating your Developer Profile.

Once a profile has been created, it will be accessible at `https://collective.supertype.ai/p/<your-name>`. Supertype Collective is tested on the latest version of Chrome, Firefox and Brave browsers.

Out of the box, your Developer Profile will:
- ðŸ“± Looks great on every device, from mobile to the largest piece of desktop hardware you can find
- ðŸ“Š Show the tech stack you use, affiliations, and other relevant information collected from GitHub or from the `data/profiles/<your-name>.json` file
- âš¡ Blazing fast, with a 100 score on Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO on Google Lighthouse (now Google PageSpeed Insights) for both mobile and desktop
- ðŸ”— API-driven, connect to your GitHub and WordPress accounts to automatically populate your profile with relevant information (more integrations to be supported soon)
- ðŸ“„ Export Developer Profile to PDF directly 
- ðŸ“¦ Infinitely customizable! Using React's famous composition pattern, you can easily author your Developer Profile using the pre-made blocks provided in the `blocks` directory, but still have the flexibility to build your own blocks

### Building Blocks 
Supertype Collective comes with a set of React components that can be used to build your profile. We call them "blocks". They are built with Tailwind CSS and are available in the `blocks` directory.

Below is a semi-complete example. You can see the output of these blocks on Supertype's co-founder [Samuel Chan](https://collective.supertype.ai/p/samuel)'s Developer Profile using these pre-made blocks:

```js
import me from '@/data/profiles/<your-name>.json'

export async function getStaticProps() {
    ...
    return {
        props: {
            data: me
        },
    }
}

const MyStack = () => {
    return (
        <Stack>
            <StackSection sectionName="AI &#38; Data">
                <IconRow tags={['pytorch', 'r', 'sql']} />
                <IconRow tags={['numpy', 'pandas', 'sklearn']} />
            </StackSection>
            ...
        </Stack>
    )
}

const Profile = ({ data }) => {    
    return (
        <Mainframe data={data}>
            <Toprow />
            <Body stack={<MyStack />} affiliations={<Affiliations />} />
        </Mainframe>
    )
}
```
