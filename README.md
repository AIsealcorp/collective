## Supertype Fellowship
[Supertype Fellowship](https://fellowship.supertype.ai) is a development program for aspiring analytics developers, data scientists and software engineers looking to build a fulfilling career in these domains. The program features a combination of expert mentoring, peer-to-peer learning, and plenty of self-directed learning from a collection of curated learning resources.

Participants are expected to spend 10-15 hours per week on the program, and will be expected to complete a series of projects and assignments. The program is largely self-paced, and participants will be able to choose from a variety of learning paths in a buffet-style format. All members of this valued community will receive plenty of mentoring, from real professionals in the field, to help them acclimate to production-level data science and software engineering.

This is a program by [Supertype (Data Science Consultancy)](https://supertype.ai) and is run in adherence to our [Philosophy](https://supertype.ai/about-us/).


## Development (for contributors)
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project.

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
